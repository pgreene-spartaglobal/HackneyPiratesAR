# HackneyPiratesAR
Developed over a 10 week period as part of the Digital Studio Practice module at Kingston University the ‘Hackney Pirates’ activity book is an augmented reality experience for Android that coupled with the ‘The Hackney Atlas’ book written by the young pirates (members of the charity) aims to bring the children’s stories to life in a fun and engaging way.  The activity book is broken down into five chapters consisting of seven games. This is accompanied by a quiz and treasure chest that is unlocked by answering a question correctly on each chapter.
